Queries..............


1)1.Retrieve all customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days:

SELECT DISTINCT c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;

2)Get the total amount of all orders placed by each customer:

SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id;

3)Update the price of Product C to 45.00:

UPDATE products
SET price = 4000.00
WHERE name = 'Product C';
SELECT* FROM products

4)Add a new column discount to the products table:

ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN discount FLOAT DEFAULT 0.00;
SELECT* from products

5)Retrieve the top 3 products with the highest price:

SELECT name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;

6)Get the names of customers who have ordered Product A:

SELECT DISTINCT c.name,p.name as product
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON p.id = o.customer_id
WHERE p.name = 'Product A';

7)Join the orders and customers tables to retrieve the customer's name and order date for each order:

SELECT c.name AS customer_name, o.order_date
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;

8)Retrieve the orders with a total amount greater than 150.00:

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 150.00;
9.Normalize the database by creating a separate table for order items and updating the orders table to reference the order_items table:
-- Create order_items table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

 -->Insert example order items (assuming some products are part of orders)

--> Update orders table to remove product-related information (if needed)
--> In this case, the product information is now in the order_items table.

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES
(1, 1, 2, 50.00),  -- jane doe ordered 2 of Product A
(1, 2, 1, 30.00),  -- jack ordered 1 of Product B
(2, 1, 3, 50.00),  -- john doe ordered 3 of Product A
(2, 3, 2, 40.00);  -- jane doe ordered 2 of Product C

10)Retrieve the average total of all orders:

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_amount
FROM orders;
